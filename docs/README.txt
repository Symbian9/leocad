About LeoCAD
------------

LeoCAD is a CAD program for creating virtual LEGO models. It's available
or free under the GNU Public License v2 and works on the Windows, Linux
and Mac OSX Operating Systems.


Installation
------------

You can download the latest version of LeoCAD and its Parts Library from
the main website at http://www.leocad.org

It's recommended that you install the latest drivers for your video card
since LeoCAD uses OpenGL to take advantage of hardware acceleration for
rendering.

- LeoCAD for Windows:

  Download latest LeoCAD-*.exe to your computer, double click on the 
  icon to launch the installer and follow the intructions.

- LeoCAD for Linux and FreeBSD:

  Many distributions now include LeoCAD so check your package manager to
  see if it's already available and install from there.

  If you decide to compile it yourself you will also need to download the
  Parts Library separately and follow the installation instructions. More
  information is available at http://www.leocad.org

- LeoCAD for macOS:

  Download latest LeoCAD-*.dmg to your computer, double click on the 
  icon to open the archive and copy LeoCAD.app to your Applications folder.

New users should take a look at the online tutorial located at
http://www.leocad.org/docs/tutorial1.html to learn how to use LeoCAD.

Unstable builds
---------------

For many Linux distributions there is OBS build system, that produce 'nightly' builds:

- Go to
  http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/pbartfai/
- Navigate in folders according Linux  disribution name you use and it's architecture (i386 or amd64)
- Download latest leocad-*.deb (if you use xUbuntu, or other package if you use other distributive)

Those builds of LeoCAD not include whole Parts Library, so you must install LDraw library parts separatly.
